<h1>About me</h1> 
<p>I am educated historian and librarian that one day decided to become a multimedia designer. But before that happened I had managed to experience a lot of different things. </p>
<p>Short after finishing my studies I found a job as librarian. Although, I had never planed to work as a librarian, it turned out to be an amazing experience. Holding that position allowed me to develop a set of information management skills. I also I participated in a number of educational, cultural and scholarly projects. </p>
<p>I was also given a great offer to join a team working on a project of a new multimedia exhibition. I was responsible for selecting materials and creating structures of presentations displayed by multitouch screens and interactive installations </p>
<p>That was a significant experience of my life which inspired to develop my graphic and IT skill. I decided to look for some new opportunities outside my homeland. Currently, I am studying at KEA hoping to gain professional education that will allow me to find a exciting job that I can enjoy.  </p>
